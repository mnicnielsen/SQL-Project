## What are your risk areas? Identify and describe them.
* Errors in my SQL code which would lead to incorrect counts
* Incorrectly assigned product categories when correcting product categories


## QA Process:
Describe your QA process and include the SQL queries used to execute it.

With more time, I would have undertaken a more thorough QA process. In this assignment, I used the following key number in my QA process: 

|Description|Count|
|---|---|
|Count of all rows|15,134|
|Count of unique fullvisitorid|14,223|
|Count of unique visitid|14,556|
|Count of sales|81|

My QA process typically involved wrapping my code in a subquery, summing my results column(s) and ensuring that the number of results added up to the appropriate count in the table above.

To check product categories, I returned all distinct product categories and ensured that this list matched my intended list of product categories. 

### Examples

* When checking how many visitors viewed more than one product, I wrapped my query in a subquery and did a count to ensure that the total number of product views was equal to the number of rows in all_sessions:

```SQL
SELECT SUM(number_of_productviews) FROM 
	(SELECT 
		fullvisitorid, 
		COUNT(visitid) AS number_of_productviews 
	FROM all_sessions
	GROUP BY 
		fullvisitorid 
	ORDER BY COUNT(visitid) DESC) AS sq3;
```

* Checked my count for 'fullvisitorid's added up to the total number of visitors by wrapping my count function in a subquery. 
```SQL
SELECT SUM(count_visitors) FROM
(SELECT 
	number_of_productviews,
	COUNT(number_of_productviews) AS count_visitors FROM 
		(SELECT 
			fullvisitorid, 
			COUNT(visitid) AS number_of_productviews
		FROM all_sessions
		GROUP BY 
			fullvisitorid 
		ORDER BY COUNT(visitid) DESC) AS sq12
	GROUP BY number_of_productviews
	ORDER BY number_of_productviews DESC) AS sq13;
```
* Check product categories
```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT newcategory FROM all_sessions WHERE totaltransactionrevenue IS NOT NULL; 
```
